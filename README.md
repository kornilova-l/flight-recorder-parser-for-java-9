```java
FlightParser flightParser = new FlightParser(new File("my_recording.jfr"));
/* in following map:
 * keys are stacktraces where method calls are separated by ';'
 * values are numbers that tell how many times this stacktrace was found in the recording
 */
Map<String, Integer> stacks = flightParser.getStacksMap();
```
